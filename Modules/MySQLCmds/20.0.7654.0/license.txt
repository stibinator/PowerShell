Money damages may not be a sufficient remedy for a breach of confidentiality. If either party breaches the confidentiality obligations, the non-breaching party may seek injunctive or other equitable relief without the necessity of posting a bond even if otherwise normally required. Such injunctive or equitable relief is in addition to all other rights and remedies available at law or in equity.  You agree that if you provide us with any suggestions, comments, or other feedback about our Confidential Information ("Feedback") such Feedback is given voluntarily. you also agree that even if you designate such Feedback as confidential, unless the parties enter into a separate subsequent written agreement, the Feedback shall not be confidential and we shall be free to use, disclose, reproduce, license, or otherwise distribute the Feedback in our sole discretion without any obligations or restrictions of any kind, including without limitation, Intellectual Property Rights.
